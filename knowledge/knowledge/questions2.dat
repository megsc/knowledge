What are dynamic variables?
Dynamic variables are variables whose memory address is determined when the program is run rather than during compilation
Describe user-defined data structures
User-defined data structure is a fixed set of fields that hold data in a format defined by the user
Describe the key features of the software development life cycle (SDLC)?
The SDLC provides a structure for system developers to plan, analyze, design, test and implement in phases
Define medium-size application development
Medium-sized application development is determined by the size of the code produced and the number of man hours required to produce it
Explain standard array and file handling algorithms
A standard array is a unsorted container that holds a fixed number of elements of the same data type which are accessed from the indexes of the array. Text File handling allows text to be read or written char by char sequentially. Binary File Handling is proccessed sequentially or using random access to read or write to. 
Describe two development methodologies and their application?
Waterfall is a sequential development process where each stage is fully planned and executed before the next stage can begin. Agile development such as a Scrum focuses on iterative stages of development and focuses on short term targets or sprints and the planning of each sprint is re-evaluated based on the previous one.
Outline the principles of language development.
A programming language requires expressive power, ease of use and implementation as well as an excellent compiler.
Outline the basic principles of project management.
Project Management is the leading of a team to achieve specific goals. This includes the initiating, planning, executing and controlling of the team's plan and managing the human resources within that team. 
Describe the importance of software specifications.
Software specifications provide a complete description of a system and how it is expected to perform. The specification is important as it establishes what the system will and won't do for both the developer and the client.
Identify the methods and importance of version control.
Version control documents the evolution of the development process and tracks/documents changes to create a version history. Methods of version control include: saving backup copies with version numbers, work from shared folders or use version control software such as Git.
